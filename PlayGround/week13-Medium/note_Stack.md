Step 1 - The stack
We'll be building medium in the following stack

1. React in the frontend
2. Cloudflare workers in the backend
3. zod as the validation library, type inference for the frontend types
4. Typescript as the language
5. Prisma as the ORM, with connection pooling
6. Postgres as the database
7. jwt for authentication (Cookies approach explained in the end as well)
